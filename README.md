# Bank-Churning
Customer Churn is the loss of clients or customers. Bank, insurance companies, streaming services companies and telcom service companies, often use customer churn analysis and customer churn rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining existing customers is far less than acquiring a new one.

This analysis focuses on the behavior of bank customers who are more likely to leave the bank (i.e. close their bank account). 

This analysis is uses sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, and pandas to determine the types of customers who are most likely to churn.
